  <p>From Doctor Vicki Fleming comes the heartwarming tale of a boy named Pete, his dog Rover, and his dog Rover created by DreamWorks Animation. You may think a boy and his dog is a tale you've heard sounds familiar, but a big twist sets this book apart: Rover plays basketball, and he's darn good at it.</p>

  <p>This story has everything you could ask for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basketball</li>
    <li>A dog</li>
    <li>Nail-biting suspense</li>
  </ul>

  <p>While it may not have had the same 10 of Rover's Championship points in one game, "Basketball Dog" will have your heart in the story of an ordinary boy and his dog loves in the game. If you love basketball or sports stories, throw for you.</p>
